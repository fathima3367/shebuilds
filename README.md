### Project Description
[This web-based "Kerala Rental Housing Portal" allows users to search for affordable rental properties in Kerala, with options for houses, apartments, and hostels under ‚Çπ8,000 per month. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the layout, styling, and dynamic property search functionality, along with a modal for user registration.]

### The Problem statement
[With the increasing number of students and professionals moving to Kerala, finding affordable rental accommodations under ‚Çπ8,000 per month can be a challenging task. The lack of a centralized, easy-to-navigate platform to search for budget-friendly housing options makes it difficult for newcomers to find suitable rental properties quickly and efficiently. Additionally, the need for verified listings, user-friendly interfaces, and a clear presentation of rental details is essential to enhance the property search experience.]

### The Solution
[The "Kerala Rental Housing Portal" is an online platform aimed at addressing the challenge of finding affordable housing in Kerala. The portal allows users to search for rental properties (houses, apartments, and hostels) across major cities in Kerala, such as Trivandrum, Kochi, Kozhikode, and Thrissur, with a focus on properties priced under ‚Çπ8,000 per month. By offering filters such as location, property type, and budget, along with detailed information about each listing, the platform aims to make the property search process easier and more efficient for users. Furthermore, the portal includes a registration feature to help users express their interest in properties and streamline the rental inquiry process. This solution leverages modern web technologies, ensuring accessibility and responsiveness for both desktop and mobile users.]
